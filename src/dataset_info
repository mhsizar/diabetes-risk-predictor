Dataset Information: The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) collected and pooled individual-level data under a 
longitudinal population-based cohort study conducted in the United States starting with a nationally representative sample of adolescents in grades
7-12 during the 1994-95 school years. Add Health followed the cohort members into young adulthood with five in home interviews. In Wave V, the researchers
collected anthropometric (including BMI), smoking status, cardiovascular, metabolic, and inflammatory measures, and biomarkers of chronic kidney diseases by
surveying 19,828 cohort members (aged 33 to 44). There were 1,712 participants with complete covariate information.
